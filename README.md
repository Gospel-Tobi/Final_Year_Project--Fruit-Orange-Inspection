This application is designed to track and inspect fruits in real-time using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. It supports tracking of three types of fruits: Tomato, Banana, and Orange. The app is built with Streamlit, a fast and easy-to-use framework for building web applications, and OpenCV for handling video streams and image processing.
